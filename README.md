## Test-Meet-API Readme

Test-Meet-API is a testing application where I try to test the integration of various meet creation APIs, including Zoom API, Google API, and Calendly API. This project serves me for the learning and a starting point for me to understand how to integrate different Meet APIS.

### APIs that I test

1. **Zoom API:** This section of the application demonstrates how to use the Zoom API to create, manage, and schedule meetings. It covers authentication, creating new meetings, and managing meeting details.

2. **Google API:** Here, you'll find examples of interacting with the Google API. This includes authentication with OAuth, creating events in Google Calendar, retrieving events, and managing event details.

3. **Calendly API:** This section shows how to work with the Calendly API. It covers authentication, listing scheduled events, creating new events, and managing event details.
